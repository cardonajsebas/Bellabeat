Every day we see, how humans direct its efforts to improve their lives by using technology; transportation, communication, education are some aspects in which we include smart devices and technology to perform our daily activities more efficiently.\nThis is a case study presented for me to complete the Google Data Analytics certification. I will present an analysis about one way, we humans, have involved technology in our lives, specifically to improve our health and daily habits. In this case I will work with data provided by Bellabeat, of a device used by women to track their activity and health.\nBellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women, needs to analyze one of their smart device data to gain insight into how their customers, women, are using their product.

Since it was founded, the company has grown and positioned itself in the tech-driven wellness market.\nTheir product is basically a tracker device called “leaf” that can be worn as a bracelet, a necklace, or a clip, and follows user data related to their activity and health, such as sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This device is connected to the Bellabeat app, which collects this data and shows it to the user and gives advice about their wellness habits and helps them make healthy decisions.\nThe company’s marketing analytics team believes that analyzing usage data from the smart devices will help them understand their customers, and gain insights in how they use the device, to guide future marketing strategies.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n> # **2.\tASK**\n\nUrška Sršen wants to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight about how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.

PREPARE**\n\n**3.1. Data source**\n\nFor this case study, the company’s CEO suggested working with a public dataset that explores smart device usage [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)). This is a Kaggle dataset that after verifying, we can confirm that is an opensource and we can work with it.\nThe dataset features 18 .csv files that contain information about the usage of a personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.\n\n\n**3.2. Dataset preview**\n\nAfter downloading and storing on a folder created for this case study purpose only, I reviewed each file, filtered, and sorted to learn more about the data itself and its quality, and understand how it is organized.\nI discovered that the study consisted in tracking the activity of 33 users during a period of 31 days between March 2016 – May 2016. It tracked information like, activity, intensity, calories burned, hearth rate, weight, and sleep on different time frames.\n\n\n**3.3. Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations I found in the dataset suggested by the CEO.\n\n* It is out of date (Period between March and May 2016).\n* Sample size could be too short and could not be representative for this kind of studies.\n* We have no demographic information about the people in the study, we do not know if there are men or women. So, for this analysis would be better to select a bigger sample of women only.\n\nAcknowledging these limitations, I did some research but unfortunately, I could not find other datasets, so I decided to continue with the analysis and get some insight on the general usage of this kind of devices.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"4\"></a> <br>\n> # **4.

Meaning they wore the device even when they were sleeping and only taking it out to take a bath for example, and some of them even used it 24 hours a day\n * Next comes regular users (Between 16.8 hr and 22.8 hr) with 36.4%, and this means they wore the device mostly while they were awake.\n * And then, with 24.2%, the occasional users, and we could say they were not as disciplined as the other users and forgot to use it some days and use it only during some hours.\n\n\n\n* One of the company goals should be to encourage the users to wear the device every day and during more time.\n\n * Analyzing the activity levels, I noticed than the highly active, and active people are less than the other groups, with the majorities being in the moderate activity levels.\nHere is an opportunity for the company. Developing marketing strategies that show how the inclusion of this kind of technologies, motivates people to have more active and healthier lives.\n\n * We can confirm that the step count feature, is one effective way to show the effectivity of the product helping track healthy habit, analyzing the steps vs calories plot we see how they tend to be related, and is very important to confirm the progress of the user and keep the motivation.\n\n * Another important trend that the company should exploit, is the usage of the device on different moments of the day, and on different occasions. Specially if the target market are women and is known that this group of people tend to be more guided by fashion trends than men. Whit this, the company could achieve more sales, by getting that one user buys more than one device, to wear them on different occasions and keep tracking their vitals.\n","metadata":{}}]}
